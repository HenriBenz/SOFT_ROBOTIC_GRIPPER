# SOFT ROBOTC GRIPPER

The Soft Robotic Gripper is a project developed during the Hardware I Seminar of the MRAC-20/21-program. The objective of the seminar is to give an overview of the state of the art in robotic actuation, discuss the practical implementation of such actuators, and brainstorm how these actuators and the robotic arms could bring new levels of versatility, agility, and efficiency to the production and construction processes.
